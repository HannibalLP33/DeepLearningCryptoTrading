<h1>Deep Learning Cryptocurrency Trading Model Trainerü§ñüöÄ</h1>

<h2>
  Project Description:
</h2>
The DeepLearningCryptoTrading repository constitutes an encompassing model trainer designed to facilitate experimentation with diverse models and trainer classes. By default, the script generates a sliding window dataset with a sequence length of 60 minutes, leveraging the Alpaca-py library. This window incorporates a range of technical indicators, including but not limited to the Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), each with distinct period lengths. The response variable hinges on the 8-minute SMA, wherein an instance is designated as 1 if the subsequent price surpasses the current instance price, and 0 if it falls below.<br><br>

Throughout the training process, a learning rate schedule is enforced with a threshold set at 10. The epoch yielding the highest F1-Score is preserved in the pretrained_models directory during pretraining and in the full_models directory during fine-tuning. A prospective expansion of this project entails formatting live data to construct the sliding window and establishing connections with various cryptocurrency exchanges for paper/live trading purposes.
